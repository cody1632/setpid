setpid is a Linux terminal program which starts a command with the specified pid.
The program can also trigger pids for the specified count.

setpid options:
        -h, --help
        -V, --version
        -C, --command "COMMAND opts"
        -c, --count NUM
        -p, --pid
        -v, --verbose

Notes:
The -p/--pid option is buggy and can only spawn ~800-900 pids on my system.
There's a faster way to obtain the same result using bash:
	time for i in `seq 1 1000`; do echo "#$i: $$"; done
finishes in 0.016s while setpid executes 1000 pids in 4.6s
